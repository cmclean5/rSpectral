\description{
This package implements the Spectral Modularity clustering algorithm for
\code{\link[igraph]{igraph}} and \code{\link[graph]{graphNEL}} graphs. The algorithm 
was proposed in \insertCite{PhysRevE.74.036104}{rSpectral} and an example
of its application to the real biological network could be found in
\insertCite{Roy:2018Regional}{rSpectral}.
