#' Spectral clustering for \code{igraph} objects
#' 
#' This function implements the network clustering algorithm described in
#' (M. E. J. Newman, 2006). 
#' 
#' The complete iterative algorithm comprises of two steps. In the
#' first step, the network is expressed in terms of its leading eigenvalue and eigenvector
#' and recursively partition into two communities. Partitioning occurs if the maximum
#' positive eigenvalue is greater than the tolerance (\code{tol=10-5}) for the current
#' partition, and if it results in a positive contribution to the Modularity.
#'
#' Given an initial separation using the leading eigen step, the function then continues to
#' maximise for the change in Modularity using a fine-tuning step - or variate thereof. The
#' first stage here is to find the node which, when moved from one community to another,
#' gives the maximum change in Modularity. This nodeâ€™s community is then fixed and we repeat
#' the process until all nodes have been moved. The whole process is repeated from this new
#' state until the change in the Modularity, between the new and old state, is less than the
#' predefined tolerance (\code{tol}).
#'
#' A slight variant of the fine-tuning step, which can reduce execution time by factor 2 to
#' 5, is also provided. Instead of moving each node into each community in turn, we only
#' consider moves of neighbouring nodes, found in different communities, to the community of
#' the current node of interest. This variant of the node-moving algorithm effectively `fixes`
#' neigbouring nodes \code{fix_neig} in the community being considered.
#'
#' The two steps process is repeatedly applied to each new community found, subdivided each community
#' into two new communities, until we are unable to find any division that results in a positive change
#' in Modularity. An additional stopping criteria, based on the minimum cluster size \code{Cn_min}, is
#' also provided.
